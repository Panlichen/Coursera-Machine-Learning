# Coursera Machine Learning
Coursera assignments of Machine Learning Course taught by Andrew Ng from Stanford University, codes are written by **MATLAB** with **Chinese code comments**.

Eight parts in total.

## ex1 Linear Regression
Linear regression with single variables and linear regression of bivariate.

## ex2 Logistic Regression
Include regularization and mapping the features.

## ex3 Logistic Regression - Multi Classification

## ex4 Neural Network
A three-layer neural network is established to solve the classification problem.

## ex5 Regularized Linear Regression and Deviation Variance
Analyze bias and variance. Polynomial regression is used.

## ex6 Support Vector Machines
The Gaussian radial basis function is used for the nonlinear support vector machine.

## ex7 Principle Component Analysis and K-Means Clustering
Using SVD for PCA.

## ex8 Anomaly Detection and Collaborative Filtering
Using the multivariate Gaussian distribution for anomaly detection.
